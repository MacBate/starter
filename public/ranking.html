<h1>The Best Movies by Mat</h1>
<h2>My personal top 3 movies of all the time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Django</h3>
<p>Story about black people back in 19th century where one of them starts to work with white man.<br />
One of the greatest Tarantino movies in my opinion, from music to the shoots - love it!</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Story about the friendship and tough prison life. What's important in our life, how relationships affect on us and our decisions. <br />
It's a must!</p>
<h3>Castelvania</h3>
<p>It's a anime on Netflix which is about the Dracula and he's son.</p>
